# Shell Fur Add-on for Godot Engine

![DemoScene](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4955051/97077434-8b0f7800-15db-11eb-98eb-7cecf1648304.png)

Add-on that adds a fur node to Godot 3.2. Demo project available [here.](https://github.com/Arnklit/ShellFurGodotDemo)


Instalation
-----------
Copy the folder addons/shell_fur into your project and activate the add-on from the **Project -> Project Settings... -> Plugins** menu.

Purpose
-------
I was inspired by games like Shadow of the Colossus and Red Dead Redemption 2 which uses this technique to try and make my own implementation in Godot.

Usage
-----
Select any MeshInstance node and add the ShellFur node as a child beneath it.

If you select the added fur node you will see the fur settings available in the inspector.

Most of the options should be self explanatory. But a few are a bit more specific.

- The **Pattern Selector** parameter allows you to set the pattern texture between three included patterns: Fine Hair, Rough Hair and Moss. The pattern textures consist of two channels, the red channel which decides the thickness of the hair along the strand and the green channel which is used to allow variation in length. You can manually select other textures using the **Pattern Texture** parameter, but random length will only work if you correctly set up the channels.

Left: Fine Hair, Middle: Rough Hair, Right: Moss.

Breakdown of Fine Hair texture - Left: Combined pattern texture, Middle: R channel, Right: G channel.

- The **Normal Correction** parameter attempts to correct the normal to be along the strand, rather than using the normal of the base mesh. Most of the time it actually seems to look best to leave this low, so the fur get's shaded in the shape of the base mesh, but if you are using thick strands or need specular highlights, you'll may need to adjust this.

Left: Normal Correction = 0.0. Right: Normal Correction = 1.0.

- The **Layers** parameter controls how many shells are generated around the object, more layers equals nicer strands, but will decrease performance.

12 layers on the left. 40 layers on the right.

- The **Blendshape Index** option allows you to style the fur with a blendshape, -1 means disabled.

Top: Base mesh, Middle: Blendshape, Bottom: Fur styled by blendshape.

- The **Normal Bias** option is used in conjunction withe blendshape styling. It mixes in the normal direction at the base.

Top: Normal Bias = 0.0, Bottom: Normal Bias = 1.0.

Current Limitations
-------------------
- Since the fur is made up of shells that are paralel to the surface, the fur can look pretty bad when seen from the side. This is somewhat mitigated by using the blendshape styling but could be further improved by adding in generated fur fins around the contour of the mesh.
- Limitations to skinned meshes. When the fur is applied to skinned meshes, MultiMeshInstance method cannot be used, so a custom mesh is generated with many layers. This is heavy on skinning performance and currently blendshapes are not copied over, so the fur will not adhere to blendshape changes on the base mesh. Using material passes would bypass this issue, but would cause a lot of drawcalls. I'm still looking into a solution for this.
